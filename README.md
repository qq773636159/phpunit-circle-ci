[x] created a github repository for this small project
[x] Coded a very small PHP Library
[x] Used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage the dependencies used by the library
[x] Unit test the php code with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).
[x] Created circle.yml file that will be used for automation by [Circle CI](https://circleci.com)
[x] Automate phpunit test cases with [Circle CI](https://circleci.com)
[x] Submitted the created library to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).

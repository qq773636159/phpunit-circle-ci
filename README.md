## Automated testing of PHP applications using PHPUnit + Circle CI

Example code I learned watching  [Howto: Release an open source PHP Composer package on Github with automated unit tests](https://youtu.be/yF5E_43J3xE)

- [x] created a github repository for this small project
- [x] Coded a very small PHP Library
- [x] Used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage the dependencies used by the library
- [x] Unit test the php code with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).
- [x] Created circle.yml file that will be used for automation by [Circle CI](https://circleci.com)
- [x] Run automated Phpunit test cases with [Circle CI](https://circleci.com)
- [x] Submitted the created library to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).

__NB__
 - for code coverage, install the php-xdebug conversion
 - precise instead trusty should be used as image (configured on settings page)
